SplicePL is a computational method to detect splice junctions from
RNA-seq reads of length greater than 100 nt. SplicePL detects splice
junctions by a three-stage process. Initially, each read is aligned to
the reference genome using BLAT, followed by identifying a spliced
read across exon-exon junction.  Finally, the putative junctions are
identified and filtered based on splice site donor/acceptor site,
intron and flanking sequence length.


SplicePL is written in PERL, free, open-source, and released under GNU GPL.
