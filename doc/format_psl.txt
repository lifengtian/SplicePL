PSL format 	
 
copied from : http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2 	

PSL lines represent alignments, and are typically taken from files generated by BLAT or psLayout. See the BLAT documentation for more details. All of the following fields are required on each data line within a PSL file:

   1. matches - Number of bases that match that aren't repeats
   2. misMatches - Number of bases that don't match
   3. repMatches - Number of bases that match but are part of repeats
   4. nCount - Number of 'N' bases
   5. qNumInsert - Number of inserts in query
   6. qBaseInsert - Number of bases inserted in query
   7. tNumInsert - Number of inserts in target
   8. tBaseInsert - Number of bases inserted in target
   9. strand - '+' or '-' for query strand. For translated alignments, second '+'or '-' is for genomic strand
  10. qName - Query sequence name
  11. qSize - Query sequence size
  12. qStart - Alignment start position in query
  13. qEnd - Alignment end position in query
  14. tName - Target sequence name
  15. tSize - Target sequence size
  16. tStart - Alignment start position in target
  17. tEnd - Alignment end position in target
  18. blockCount - Number of blocks in the alignment (a block contains no gaps)
  19. blockSizes - Comma-separated list of sizes of each block
  20. qStarts - Comma-separated list of starting positions of each block in query
  21. tStarts - Comma-separated list of starting positions of each block in target 

Example:
Here is an example of an annotation track in PSL format. Note that line breaks have been inserted into the PSL lines in this example for documentation display purposes. Click here for a copy of this example that can be pasted into the browser without editing.

Be aware that the coordinates for a negative strand in a PSL line are handled in a special way. In the qStart and qEnd fields, the coordinates indicate the position where the query matches from the point of view of the forward strand, even when the match is on the reverse strand. However, in the qStarts list, the coordinates are reversed.

Example:
Here is a 30-mer containing 2 blocks that align on the minus strand and 2 blocks that align on the plus strand (this sometimes can happen in response to assembly errors):

0         1         2         3 tens position in query  
0123456789012345678901234567890 ones position in query   
            ++++          +++++ plus strand alignment on query   
    --------    ----------      minus strand alignment on query   

Plus strand:   
     qStart=12 
     qEnd=31 
     blockSizes=4,5 
     qStarts=12,26 
                  
Minus strand:   
     qStart=4 
     qEnd=26 
     blockSizes=10,8 
     qStarts=5,19   

Essentially, the minus strand blockSizes and qStarts are what you would get if you reverse-complemented the query. However, the qStart and qEnd are not reversed. To convert one to the other:

     qStart = qSize - revQEnd
     qEnd = qSize - revQStart
